# Let's Talk About CVE-2025-53770 — The New Zero-Day Targeting Microsoft SharePoint

Before diving into the newly discovered and actively exploited vulnerability affecting Microsoft SharePoint, let's first clarify what a CVE is.

---

## What is a CVE?

Based on Red Hat's definition:

> "CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number."  
> — Source: Red Hat

In this case, we're looking at **CVE-2025-53770**, which stands for:

> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures of the year 2025, vulnerability number 53770.

## What's the Deal With CVE-2025-53770?

On **July 19, 2025**, Microsoft and security researchers disclosed a **zero-day vulnerability** in Microsoft SharePoint on-premise servers, which is already being exploited in the wild.

A *zero-day* refers to a security hole that is unknown to the vendor and has no immediate fix at the time of discovery — making it extremely dangerous.

**This flaw allows an unauthorized remote attacker to execute arbitrary code** over the network due to the **deserialization of untrusted data** on the SharePoint server.

- **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
- **Vulnerability Type:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)  
- **Authentication Required:** None (unauthenticated attacker)  
- **Attack Vector:** Network

## What Is Deserialization of Untrusted Data?

Deserialization is the process of using stored data and converting it into an object that can be used in the memory.

When this process is applied to untrusted or malicious data **without proper validation**, it can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the data structure and execute malicious code on the server.

That's exactly what's happening with **CVE-2025-53770** — SharePoint is processing attacker-supplied input and unknowingly executing it.

---

## What Could an Attacker Do?

An attacker can send a specially crafted request to a vulnerable SharePoint server. Since authentication isn't required, any exposed SharePoint instance is an open target.

Once exploited, the attacker may:

- Run arbitrary commands on the server.  
- Move laterally through the internal network.  
- Exfiltrate sensitive documents and data.  
- Drop ransomware or install backdoors.

## Affected SharePoint Versions

If you're using any of the following versions, you're potentially vulnerable:

- Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2010  
- Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2013  
- Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 (prior to version 16.0.5513.1001)  
- Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 (prior to version 16.0.10417.20037)  
- Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition (prior to version 16.0.18526.20508)

---

## What Should Defenders Do?

Microsoft has released patches and updates in response to this vulnerability.

- [Microsoft Security Advisory](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770)  
- Use endpoint detection tools like Tenable: [Tenable Advisory](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53770)

## Testing Personally

I'm not performing any tests myself, as I don't have explicit permission to do so. However, I've been observing tests conducted by more experienced professionals who do have authorized access to test environments.

That said, I'm still examining shared payloads and public proof-of-concept code — like those found in this GitHub repository — to deepen my understanding of how the exploit works.

---

## Final Thoughts

CVE-2025-53770 is another critical reminder that **legacy on-premise software** — especially collaboration platforms like SharePoint — needs constant patching and network segmentation.

The fact that this RCE requires **no authentication** makes it all the more urgent.
